People.graph - builds a graph database of people connected via data available on the web 
=====

The application crawles Wiki pages, analyses the content 
using simple NLP methods and generates data in graph database. 

Currently, the application analyze only some Polish Wiki pages - this is the only source of data so far. 
Application supports two database outputs: Neo4j and OrientDB. 

The goals of the project:
1. Build graph database of people connected via information available on the network.
2. Learn and analyze data using available graph algorithms.
3. Compare the performance between different graph databases. 

Here are some performance results achieved during importing data:

** Neo4j 3.3.3 **
